 // Model classes //
 All classes for DB should be written like this:
 Mongo.Users.Fired.mng

 Where
 'Fired' is table (entity)
 '.mng' is 'extension' (the type of data model, e.g. xml, mysql,mongodb etc.)
 'Mongo.Users' are directories and subdirectories



 // Controller classes //
 All classes for DB should be written like this:
 /user/register/checkLogin

 Where
 'checkLogin' is the function of a controller called to execute
 'register' is the class of the controller (it originally named 'ControllerRegister' so the last word is taken)
 '/user/..../' are directories and subdirectories within "Controllers" directory
